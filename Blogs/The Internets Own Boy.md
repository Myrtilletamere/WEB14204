#Internet's Own Boy

How do I feel about freedom of information? *vague hand movement and half-shrug* kinda meh. 

I mean, don’t get me wrong – I’m all about having access to information, very specifically the important kind: financial reports of the governments spending, cats, documents about wars that have been hidden to protect the reputation of the US, and more…

But here’s my issue. Things seem to be both more and more open-source, and hidden even deeper. We have all these amazing pieces of codes, maps and instructions to build your own prosthetics for 1/10th of what pharmaceutical company would sell, recipes for a better life – and at the same time, only when we get a very spectacular piece of information about the government, the war, the CIA, do we realise *how much* is still hidden. <br>
And how much is going to stay hidden. 

There’s this saying about how the truth always comes out, but the thing is, most of the time it’s too late. Most of the time, because we have to fight to get that truth, then it is deemed illegal, perjury, treason. And it’s only to learn that for years some awful things have happened without us knowing. But most of the bad guys are either dead or rich straight white males, so not much can be done anyway, except that they swear it won’t happen again, and it still does. 

I realise I sound super bitter. *Ew.* Bottom line is: I fucking love the idea of freedom of information, I’m all for it, I want it to happen, and I will fight for it anyway I can – but I know it cannot be measured in anyway. We can’t say ‘Ah. Now we know everything and everything will be known to us. Good job, us.’. It’s an ever going battle. 

Don’t even get me started on Net Neutrality. This shit is insane. For a few month, we had over our heads the threats of having internet providers literally decided which content was going to be the most important. JUST IMAGINE. 
 Brands paying millions to erase competition. Just having to bribe the providers and BOOM. 
This was a nightmare, I swear.

In Case Of Powers, I would go with… - Wait, why are we dividing good on one side and mountains of cash on the other? I could do so much good with moutains of cash!!?? Even just two mountains! Just picture it: I first divide an entire mountain to give a fuckload (I’m assuming we’re talking big ass mountains here) to a lot of charities. Then I keep some to live for a few years (I still have a job, so I don’t need much), and invest the rest. It yields a profit, and I can make some more good with that. Also, I assume that the powers are unlimited, so I can make more cash when needed. <br>

With a bit of chance, the world economy collapses, and I buy everyone’s debts, we can start again on healthy bases, no more capitalism, and then I buy a planet and go there so that I’m not tempted with too much power. **Boom.**

 So yeah, cash all the way.
