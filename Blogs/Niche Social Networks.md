#The Time Is Ripe For Niche Social Networks

Just read this article about niche social networks, written by Johan Attby, where he predicts the future and sees that it will holds an intense increase in niche social networks. How much, you ask? So many, he says.<br>
He bases his vision of the future on the evolution of smartphone usage. According to him, the easy access to apps while on the move and in one place (your mobile phone) allows the so-old-and-obsolete forums with only a few members to now reach to a critical mass of users.

Although this reasoning makes sense on the short term, with the very obvious always-growing use of smartphones and tablets, I feel like the author is missing one big point about humans in general, the thing that made the web in general, Facebook, and even smartphones such successes and indispensable aspects of our lives – the need to *have everything in one place*.<br> We got the radio and the telephone and then the TV, and everything was working perfectly (for the times) independently, but we decided to put it all together in smartphones. It’s not perfect, just ask Burak about trying to watch a football game when the 4G is bad, and sometimes my phone just turns off, but we love it, because everything is *right there*.<br>

Which is why I think so many niche networks, no matter how well they’re made and how accessible they are, usually have a very short life-span. Because after a while, you get tired of remembering to go on this specific thing for your tv shows, on this other app for your to-do lists, and on a third one to keep up with what your friends are doing. You want everything there, so you go back on Facebook, write a to-do list in your notes then on a post-it then on your arm because you keep on forgetting to actually look at the to-do list, and in a few weeks, maybe you’ll download the new app about fishing. 

Bottom line, Facebook’s not dead yet, and fishing is not that great and quite cruel to the fishes tbh.
