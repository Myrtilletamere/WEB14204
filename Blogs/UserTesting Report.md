#User-Tseting Report

<br>The user-testing helped a lot on different points for this projects:

-	The users brought to my attention some basic issues that I missed – the non-existence of a Log-In button for example, or a way to go back to the home page without having to click on home page again.


-	It gave the whole thing a fresh point of view, and helped with determining the different needs of different kind of users. The product designer (Callum) and a designer (my mum) focused a lot on the appearance and back-end functionality – how I was making everything work, ways to make it better, etc. Whereas my flatmate, not at all working in those areas (she does post-prod), focused a bit more on the front-end functionalities – what things were doing exactly, what she could achieve with the app, etc. I made it really interesting to have those two sides of testing on the website.
Concretely, I implemented the “slide to the left” functionality to several pages, making it easier to access more information without changing pages (to get more info on a work-out for example, see wireframes), discarded some load off the “get started” page (that has too much writing according to almost everyone’s opinion), and designed the profile page as it is now, when I hesitated between those three options:

-	Last but not least, it also gave me some much needed validation on my idea. To explain simply the basics to people who didn’t know the website at all, and have them understand and be interested by it was very nice and helped me take the rest of their ideas in a better way. 
I came up with a to-do list after this (I know you love this Matteo, so I even used Trello like you wanted):

All in all, it was great, I learned a lot, it also made my project better, A+, would recommend.
