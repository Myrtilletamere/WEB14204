#Interviewing Humans

I actually interviewed or had intense talks only with people I already knew quite well, so some of the advice of this article were a bit lost on me. Those that I always used and worked well for me though, were the following:

-	Open-ended questions – or at least, a demand of explanation after a yes/no question. I found that if I combine the two, people tend to get less self-conscious about expressing their ideas. For example, instead of asking “What do you think of the gym?”, I ask “Do you go frequently to the gym? Can you explain why?”, and get way more descriptive answers about money, time, ambiance, etc.

-	Leave a silence - Although the main interview I used for my research was in writing, when I talked to some other people face to face, I tend to wait until they say themselves “So, yeah, that’s it” or some other variation before asking another question. I also tend to rephrase what they just said to make sure I understood the intent behind their answer, especially when they’re a bit convoluted. 

-	Ask for details – or examples. It makes it easier when I realize people are struggling to express their idea. A nice example allows them to feel like they’ve said what they wanted, and I get to understand their point better. 


-	Checklist – I have some pretty bad anxiety, so I tend to do lists of a lot of things – it’s the same for big talks with people. Even for the interview by Skype or email, I make a bulletpoint list for myself first, to make sure I have all the ideas down, and then phrase them into question. Even if I don’t look at it much during a face to face, that gives me reassurance. And I think people can find it a bit more professional. 


I had a written interview (via Skype), and two long talks (not exactly interviews, but I got a lot of data out of it nonetheless) for this project. I used quotes of the written interview for my presentation, and some points and ideas I had scribbled down from the talks as ‘thought-starters’ – things I hadn’t considered before, but made a point that could be used for my project (a big part of the WorkAlendar system came from my friend Pauline talking about her problem with regularity in her workouts, for example).
