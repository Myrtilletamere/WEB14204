#Invisible Design

Ah, really really good article. You can never go wrong with a rhino story.

I really like the fact that the author acknowledges the primal instincts that can influence a design. (cf “some deep, primal part of your brain is worried that the banner ad might just eat you.”). It is something that’s not often talked about, but the “wonky” feeling that some things have is something I experienced so much without being able to explain it… 

The thing is. I guess for some people this instinct is deeper than others. I have had several situations where a drawing, a sound, a website, etc, was feeling weird and wonky and *just not right*, and someone else would be like ‘no wtf this is pretty cool’.

This can be pretty frustrating.

I guess we can also link this to the weird feel we get when watching old or bad movies, where you just know that it has been shot in front of a green screen. Something about the light, the way they move… You just know.
I do find really nice to be able to put a name on this. It is something I take into account when I design a piece, this weird feeling, but I don’t think I’ve ever done it consciously.

Will do.
