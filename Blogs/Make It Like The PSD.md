#Make It Like The PSD

In this article, Dan Govan talks in a very thought-through way about the issue that PSD files present when used as a project overview – the main issue being that you can never code a real website to have it look the exact same way as a PSD. And that non-programmers don’t realize that.<br><br>
Some of the major problems in presenting a PSD as a design example include the non-responsivity of the PSD format (you have to set an exact width, so god forbid your browser varies sizes), the change in copywriting (the design is often all set up around a specific copy which will most likely be changed before going live), fonts (which do not render in the same way in PS or the browser), and impossible stuff generally speaking. <br>

Some solutions to this problem would be to have designers having bases of code, a specific graphic charts before making the PSDs, collaboration between designers and developers, and simply stop using PS all together. 

One of the issue with that solution, and the reason so many people still use PSD as project deliverable is that PS is a fairly easy-to-use software and gives a polished result very quickly, even if the product is not done. I am not particularly skilled at creating nice designs in PS, but can see the appeal – instead of having empty grey boxes in a simple wireframe app, you can have something that looks like an actual website, and feel more advanced in the building process. 

Personally, I like hand-drawn wireframes better. You can have nice colours and add weird comments to them, and it often impresses people. That’s the dream.
