#Are UI Walkthrough Evil?

YOU WILL NOT TAKE THE UI WALKTHROUGH FROM ME


I get that, when used inappropriately, walkthroughs can be super annoying – when you can’t skip them, when each step takes foreeeeeeeeeeeeeveeeeeeeeer (just write ‘swipe left’, don’t make a 6 seconds long animation to show me.), when it interrupts the navigation flow…

But there are other ways, as the author said. Just put a nice ‘help’ button. An option, when opening an app or site for the first time, to go through the walkthrough, and makes it clear that if you don’t, you can still find it easily later. Sequenced walkthroughs, made so that you can see what this very specific thing do, not the rest – not while you don’t need it. 

The whole point, I think, is to dose the amount of information you throw at the user. Not too much, because it becomes annoying and overwhelming to be shown every single details of an app before you even know what you’re going to do with it. But not nothing, and easily accessible, so that the user doesn’t feel abandoned and lost.

I’ve had a lot of bad experience with UI walkthroughs, mostly made of pop-ups that don’t stop popping (remember that shitty paperclip from MS word?), unskippable and unnecessary ones, and unhelpful ones. 

An alternative could be having some very seductive person appear and whisper the walkthrough in your ear in a really nice and sexy voice. I’d be down for that.
