#Issue Map

This whole session has been a bit confusing tbh, as I was pretty sure that the main issue I was working on was the lack of ‘appropriate’ network around fitness for people who lacked knowledge and/or money and/or motivation. <br>
Apparently it wasn’t, according to our lecturer, but the main issue wasn’t clear either. According to her, there actually wasn’t that much of an issue, which led to ‘well, no offense, but this website might not be necessary’.<br>
I thought a lot about it (after the initial and to be expected ‘Wtf?’ reaction I had), to try and determine if she had indeed a point with that.<br>
 
The thing is: I don’t think she does. 

Of course, some people who have no issue whatsoever motivating themselves to do work-out properly and regularly without ever giving up do exist – so do people who climb the Everest and don’t die in the process, and people who didn’t have anything to eat in the past 10 hours and are sitting in front of an amazing cake and can resist. 

But this network is not for these (incredible and very respectable although frankly frightening) people. It’s for those for whom motivation and self-control is an issue, no matter how big (so most of human beings if we’re being honest).

So, going back to the point. 

**Main issue:** lack of appropriate support system for the aforementioned target. Networks for gym warriors exist, so do cute blogs to follow for fitness addicts and personal apps to track your workout, but there is no actual social network with proper functionalities for people who do not belong to those categories. 

**Causes:** Lack of money & motivation – the easy solution for those people would be to go to the gym or join a workout group. But the lack of those two very important resources, money & motivation, makes both quite difficult.

**Context:** I am not quite sure about this one – I tend to think that Human Nature is the context, but it does seem a bit vague. Capitalist Economy is only slightly better, although it fits quite well with the causes. 

I felt, after this exercise, that even though the context part is unclear to me, the rest seemed pretty complete – it doesn’t feel like there is a particular gap in my understanding of the issue, except for the part where I forgot that some people are amazingly strong-willed and won’t need my network. 

But I think I’m okay with that.
