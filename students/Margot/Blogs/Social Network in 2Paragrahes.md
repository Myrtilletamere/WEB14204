#My social network in 2 paragraphs

<br>
The Fitness Social is a social network built around fitness aimed at people who lack the money and/or the motivation to go to the gym, and who have trouble exercising regularly by themselves. By providing the possibility to create a personal work-out calendar (WorkAlendar) with reminders and rewards, and to connect to other people to get support or find a challenge, this social helps keeping a regular work-out schedule without feeling alone/desperate/lazy and giving up.

I have currently the general design of the website already laid out, including the copywriting tone and the way the interface will work.
