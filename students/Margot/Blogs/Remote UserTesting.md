#Remote User-Testing

For the remote user testing of my first wireframes, I mostly used the UsabilityHub, as I didn’t  manage to find real life people to test them. 
I did 2 series of test on the hub; a 5 seconds test of the home page to get people’s first impression on it.

Questions I asked: 

 - What was the most prominent element on the page?
 - Which element of the page did you focus on most?
 - Did the page make you want to look further into the website?
 

The main problem I had with this resides, I think, in the way I phrased my questions. I should have made them more clear and open, “Based on the layout of information, not on the subject itself, did the page make you want to look further into the website” for example (a lot of the answer I got were based on the subject only). 

I also did a Click test on the same page, with the instruction being “where would you click to get started on the website?”. I got 16 answers, with the following result:

This helped me organise my design, to decide where to put important information on the pages. Note the fact that the average response took 16 seconds – it may seem a bit long, but with the main idea of the website being open to newcomers to look through, I found it quite satisfying.
