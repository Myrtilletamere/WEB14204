 - Works insane hours, so no time for gym or anything
 - Doesn't like signing up online  - no actual network, barely goes on FB or LinkedIn
 - Not too keen on being accessible (can't even leave her a message on her cell phone, because she won't listen to it)

 - "You could just wake up around 6.30 in the morning and you'd have the time to workout as well you know?" *sure mum*
 - Really like the idea of a fitness network, wants it to be pretty and accessible on mobile/tablet, think about a 'corkboard feel' to it

###Transcript:
**Q: What are the social networks you use the most, what do you use them for, and why those specifically?**<br>
**A** : The social networks I use the most would be tumblr and facebook. Facebook I mostly use to contact people I don’t know personally enough to have their other contact information, and to stay in touch in group study, exchanging work. 
Tumblr is for moral, to learn, be inspired and to laugh. 
Those sites specifically because they’re the ones where I don’t have to directly act, I can just watch, reblog or like.
   
**Q: How long do you spend on them per day (give an estimate)?**<br>
**A**: Per day I’d say around 2-3 hours for tumblr and 1 hour for fb, but that’s an average on a slow day it can easily go up to 6-7 hours for tumblr!
   
**Q: Do you go to the gym? If yes, how regularly? If no, why? Give as many reasons as you can (money, time, travel, ambiance, etc)**<br>
**A** : The gym? No thanks, everyone’s crazy there!! More seriously, I’ve been dragged there a few times by friends (looks sideways…) but I’ve never made a habit of it. Mostly because it’s expensive and I’m not sure I could motivate myself enough to make my money’s worth and also because I always feel very self-conscious around those very sporty persons.

**Q: Do you work out by yourself at home? If yes, how regularly? If no, why?**<br>
**A** : I’m gonna go ahead and say yes! It’s nothing to fancy, half an hour almost every day doing easy gymnastic moves and stretching, and I go for a run once in a blue moon.

**Q:Do you use any fitness focused social media or website? Which, why, and how often?** <br> 
**A** : Okay, what the fudge is fitness focused social media? This is gonna be a quadruple no for this question! Except if you count in the few posts on tumblr that I reblogged explaining how to do basic work out (they’re probably under the tag “for later, someday maybe”)!
