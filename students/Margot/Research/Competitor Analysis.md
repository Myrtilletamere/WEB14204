#Competitor Analysis
<br><br>

##Blogilates

 - **Audience Size:** 31.1K on Twitter, 940K Insta, 2 322 541 Youtube, #2 Online influencers in the world of fitness in 2012 by ShareCare
 - **Offer:** Tutorial videos, recipes, meal plans, fashion, workout calendar, book, fitness classes in physical locations
 - **Target:** Mostly female, age range 16-40++(not specifically defined, but this is the main audience), all around the world
 - **Basic Functioning:** Works on follows and reblogs, favorites, likes, etc. Totally *vertical/pyramidal*, 1 head/thousands of followers. Blogilates App allows you to fill a calendar, access recipes based on specific ingredients/type of food.<br>
Does more and more meetings in physical locations through her network (as opposed to before, she did classes on one side & network on the other).
 - **Tone:** Mega friendly, chirpy, super hype & bouncy. Everything is pink, everything is awesome, she barely even sweats in the videos. *"Train like a beast, look like a beauty"* <br>
 - **Major Selling Points:** Friendliness, accepts people at all size and doesn't push for being thin - she pushes for feeling good about yourself. Very regular & qualitative content.
 - **Defaults:** Although she reblogs & respond a lot, it's mostly a one way thing - she posts content, people consume it. The community exists only around her.
 - **Test:** I've used her monthly challenge a couple of times, really liked it as it is well described & full - you have a printable calendar, and access to videos & gifs explaining the moves. Kinda lost interest after a while because I dropped out of the exercises and felt out of the loop, also the videos, even though short, still take some time to watch. Lack of incentive to go through the work. 

##Fitocracy

 - **Audience Size:** <1Million users, 62K FB, 33.3K Twitter, 4,127 Insta
 - **Offer:** Social network, nutrition guidance & workout plans, accountability/tracking of your evolution
 - **Target:** All genders, 16-40+ (audience seem less varied in age and body type than Blogilates), all around the world
 - **Basic Functioning:** Follow (other users), log in workouts and exercises, point system. More *horizontal*, but still big system of 'Fitness Leaders', those with tons of points and followers
 - **Tone:** Nerdy, gamey - 'level', 'quests', 'title', 'achievements', etc. But becomes serious as soon as you go into the workout part. 
 - **Major Selling Point:**  Gamification of fitness, Arnold Schwarzenegger is their friend and collaborated with them, recognition of your fitness achievements by the crowd
 - **Defaults:** Little to no clear explanation of the way the whole thing works - the game part seem far fetched, as if they just added game vocabulary to an otherwise pretty common point-based network
 - **Test:** I signed up, tried to set up a workout, and gave up. The website is quite confusing with a pretty bad UX, and as a matter of fact most of the messages on the social part of the website are of people confused by the site and the app. ![Example. Very confused user about a lame app.](http://i59.tinypic.com/241l6ax.png)<br> 
Big issue of the freemium plan - a lot of what they advertise ends up being only accessible to premium members, making the use of the website as a plain user pretty limited. <br>
Little to no guidance through setting up workouts - as a beginner in fitness vocabulary, i wasn't really sure what I was doing. I didn't even get to the game part.

###Recap
 - Great ideas of offers for both, although each misses what the other offers
 - Main defaults: poor accessibility for Fitocracy, poor networking functionnalities for Blogilates
 - **Great if mixed together:** Blogilates' tone & content, Fitocracy's support system - then functionalities (work out calendar, tutorials, accountability/tracking of personal evolution, crowd recognition through open network)

##Some Numbers

###Hypothesis
 - Fitness as a 'relaxed' activity (not gym warriors) seems to be pretty spread in age, between 16-30 
 - People tend to make yearly/seasonal resolutions, but drop out quite quickly (motivation & time problem)
 - Most people work out alone or in small groups when not at the gym (more comfortable, but lack of support?)
 

###Evidence (relative)

 - In average, after 6 months, 40 to 50% of gym members are considered drop outs (attending less than once a week/4 times a month)  [Source](http://www.ptdirect.com/training-design/exercise-behaviour-and-adherence/attendance-adherence-drop-out-and-retention-patterns-of-gym-members)

 - Gym Demographics:<br><br>

While ages range from 9yo to 80, main members are between 20-30yo <br><br><br>

'Fitness' activities mainly found in gyms (cardiovascular equipment, yoga, aerobics) are mostly engaged in by women<br><br><br>

###Recap: 
 - Average gym members demographic: female, 20-30yo
 - Let's keep in mind we are talking about people who can afford the gym
 - Big problem in attendance: high peak around New Year's ang mid-spring (NY's resolutions & 'bikini body' pressure), then up to 50% drop out in the following 2 to 6 months (keeps on dropping afterwards) (CF ONBOARDING & REMINDERS for the website - throughout the year, but specifically at those 'trying' times)
 - More than 50% of people like to work out alone better
 - ***Hypothesis validated* - need for a service aimed mostly at 16-30 yo (++), with tutorials and clear explanations, incentive to keep motivation up, and possibility to workout alone while still having an access to support**
