#User Personas & Stories <br><br>

##Megan


 - 20's
 - Student (broke) 
 - Average size
 - Used to social networks, can use computer basics (text, spreadsheets, mails, etc)
 - 15 to 20 hours of class a week, plus homework & part-time job (10h/week)
 - No background of working out or going to the gym - never practised a sport after the age of 15 (PE not included)
 - Megan wants to start working out to keep in shape (ew poor students food), but is obviously broke (ew poor student) and don't have the time. She has tried to start working by herself with and without friend, but without success - she lacks both knowledge to work out properly and motivation to keep it up on a regular basis and look up advice as well. 
 - Mainly needs the Fitness Social for: the workout tutorials, the support system and the WorkAlendar reminders.


 
##Elisa
 - 21
 - Student (not so broke)
 - Average size to plumpy
 - Computer savvy - bases of HTML knowledge
 - 25 to 30 hours of class per week, +homework 
 - Some background in WO & gym attendance, although not extensive - never practised a sport after the age of 14 (PE not included, although we were quite good at not doing anything). Does 30 mins/day WO, runs from time to time, when dragged by her flatmate.
 - Elisa spends a lot of time sitting, she wants to stay healthy and also lose some weight. She could afford a specific class (yoga for example) instead of the gym, but the times of her classes are not fixed, and she cannot afford to block 4 fixed hours a week for sport. She also feels self-conscious around other sporty people when working-out, which is why she doesn't go at the gym.
 - She does workout for about 30 mins almost everyday, basic stretching and easy moves - she doesn't feel confident enough to try more. 
 - Mainly needs the Fitness Social for: the WO tutorials, the support while still working alone (no one to see hear sweaty if she doesn't want to), a challenging WOBuddy.



##Danny

 - 35
 - Full-time Store Manager (Â£10/hour approx)
 - Average size
 - Average technical competences - can use emails & specific softwares related to his job, not much more
 - 40 hours/week job
 - Married, 2 kids (5 and 8)
 - Practiced swimming when younger (in his days), muscle memory, but not used to 'land workouts' and never really used the gym after his 20's.
 - Danny wants a way of staying fit now that he's approaching 40, and have a few moments a day to himself. He could afford the gym but has 0 time for it between his kids and his job. He tried to sign up on Fitocracy, but he got intimidated, and is looking for something a bit more laid-down. He can spend 30 mins to an hour top a day working out. 
 - If he could get his wife to join it, he'd be really glad - they do need to connect, these days. But they can't seem to organise their time to get some moments together.
 - Mainly needs the Fitness Social for: the WorkAlendar synchronisation (with his wife!), the reminders and rewards, and the WO tutorials.
